# MAC Address Changer

This command-line MAC address spoofer allows the user to mask their MAC address from the command-line. It asks the user to specify an interface, choose a new MAC address, and then masks their real MAC addresss with the new, specified one. This was written as part of a course on ethical hacking and Python concepts by Zaid Sabih.
